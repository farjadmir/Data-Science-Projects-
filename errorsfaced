The first error that i faced was while loading the dataset in the Jupyter Notebook, as the encoding was different 
I had to change the encoding format of the pandas reading for the dataset to import the data succesfully.


error 1:


So incase if you are facing encoding error, Change the encoding to the 'latin1'

I figured this solution out from stacks-overflow

Remember: I was using Kali Linux but 'latin1' encoding works for all the OS's be it MAC or Windows or Linux.


error 2:


 The second error I faced was while using the pandas as_matrix() function.

i solved this error by simply updating my libraries.

Note: If you are using the previous versions, and if you are receiving error at to_numpy() function, please change it to as_matrix().


error 3:

 
In drawing the 3D plots, i was confused by not being able to view the centers i had drawn, i tried different parameters but i was not able to visualize them , this is because the centers were totally covered inside the datapoints in the 3D plot. 
But, there were some parts of the centers where the data points were bit scattered, that were visible. 


error 4: 


Transforming value to a log scale for K-means clustering. without transformation it wont work.
while importing code from the silhouette analysis, make sure to fit in values and variables carefully and make sure your data is properly cleaned and Transformed into a log scale.

Make sure to properly use inverse-transformation on the log scale to get back the nubers into normal scale for analysis. 

The resources i have listed have hepled me leaps and bounds in performing the required operations.
